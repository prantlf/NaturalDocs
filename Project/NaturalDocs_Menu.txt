# Cut and paste the lines below to change the order in which your files
# appear on the menu.  Don't worry about adding or removing files, Natural
# Docs will take care of that.
# 
# If you change the title of a file, make sure you remove "auto-title,"
# from the parenthesis or it won't stick.  Add "auto-title," to the
# the parenthesis before the file name and Natural Docs will generate the
# title from the source file and keep it updated automatically.
# 
# You can further organize the menu by grouping the entries.  Add a
# "Group: [name] {" line to start a group, and add a "}" to end it.  Groups
# can appear within each other.
# 
# You can add text and web links to the menu by adding "Text: [text]" and
# "Link: [text] ([URL])" lines, respectively.
# 
# You can add indexes to the menu by adding "Index: [name]" or
# "[type] Index: [name]" to the menu.  The types are Class, Function, and
# File.  If you don't add a type, it will be an index of everything.
# 
# The formatting and comments are auto-generated, so don't worry about
# neatness when editing the file.  Natural Docs will clean it up the next
# time it is run.  When working with groups, just deal with the braces and
# forget about the indentation and comments.
