This is a fork of Natural Docs adding more functionality, namely:

* Additional text styles: italic, monospaced and strikethrough text
* The full JavaScript language support

Quoting the author from the [original project pages]
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/naturaldocs):
> [Natural Docs](http://www.naturaldocs.org)
is an open-source documentation generator for multiple programming languages.
You document your code in a natural syntax that reads like plain English.
Natural Docs then scans your code and builds high-quality HTML documentation
from it.
